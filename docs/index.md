This is the documentation of [Boltz](https://boltz.exchange) version 2.0.0.

## What is Boltz

Boltz is an instant and non custodial crypto currency exchange that focuses on the adoption of second layer scaling technologies like the Lightning network and the privacy of its users. We neither use any trackers nor log any data that could identify our users.

## Instances

We are running and maintaining two Boltz instances that can be used. The Boltz REST API can be found in the subdirectory `/api` of both URLs.
