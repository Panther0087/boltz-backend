# Boltz tools

This scripts were written and are used with `Python 3.7.3` or higher. Older versions *might* work too but I wouldn't rely on that.

Unlike the `docker/build.py` script these ones have dependencies that have to be installed. To do that a virtual environment has to be created with:

```bash
virtualenv .venv
```

To install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm run python:install
```
